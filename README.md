# üéôÔ∏è React Podcast Landing Page

This project is a responsive landing page for a podcast discovery application, built entirely with React. The application fetches a list of podcasts from an external API and displays them in a clean, modern grid layout. It is designed to be fast, user-friendly, and fully responsive across all common screen sizes.


## ‚ú® Features

*   **Dynamic Data Fetching**: Fetches a list of real podcasts from the [Podcast API](https://podcast-api.netlify.app/) on page load.
*   **Loading & Error States**: Displays a clear "Loading..." message while fetching data and shows a user-friendly error message if the API fails.
*   **Responsive Grid Layout**: The podcast grid automatically adjusts to look great on mobile, tablet, and desktop screens using CSS Grid.
*   **Reusable Components**: Built with modular and reusable React components, primarily a `PodcastCard` component that can be used anywhere in the app.
*   **Detailed Previews**: Each podcast card displays key information:
    *   Podcast Cover Image
    *   Title
    *   Number of Seasons
    *   Associated Genre Names
    *   Last Updated Date (formatted for human readability, e.g., "September 15, 2022").
